I'm a researcher and data scientist at Stanford University in the [Computational Psychology & Well-Being (CPWB) lab](https://cpwb.stanford.edu/people#:~:text=and%20especially%20dancing.-,Samuel%20Campione,-Data%20Scientist%0A%0ASamuel). My background in psychology, linguistics, and data science informs my work in AI, clinical psychology, and NLP. 

I design and build patient and clinician-facing digital mental health tools that are grounded in evidence-based practice (EBPs) for PTSD and emotional disorders. Collaborating with clinical psychologists and computer scientists, I help conduct experiments with our clinical AI tools and evaluate results using statistics and natural language processing. 


## Clinical psychology & data science

* Clinically-grounded AI to augment training in evidence-based practices 
* Developing AI tools to help patients finish worksheets to increase efficacy of evidence-based psychotherapy
* Understanding use of LLMs for mental health and why
* Using social media for real-time monitoring of public health and mental health
